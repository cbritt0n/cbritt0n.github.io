          <p class="sectionContent">I worked on computers with multiple operating systems such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OSX. I also have experience with server-side components such as file servers, email servers, switch configurations, etc. I also worked with teachers to address their specific needs as they pertain to learning with technology in the classroom. I assisted in the sale of many devices to teachers in hopes that the technology may help them in their teaching endeavours. I used different software packages such as Adobe Creative Cloud to edit audio and video for different School System functions.</p>
